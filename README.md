# Flutter SQLite User Management System

This project is a mobile application built with Flutter that manages user data using an SQLite database. It demonstrates basic database operations (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete) and provides an interface to manage user information.

Features:
Database and Table Creation:

The SQLite database is automatically created when the app starts.
Necessary tables are initialized to store user information.
Add Data (Register):

Users can add data such as name, surname, email, phone, address, and country to the database.

All registered users are displayed in a list view.
The list updates dynamically with any changes.

Users can edit their information, and the changes are saved to the database.

Users can be removed from the database by tapping the delete (trash) icon next to their name.

Registered users can log in and view their profile details.
Profile information can be edited and updated.
